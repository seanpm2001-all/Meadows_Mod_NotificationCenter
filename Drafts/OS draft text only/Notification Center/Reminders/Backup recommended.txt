Backup recommended
Every once in a while, you should continue backing up your data, in case your
computer might fail.You should back up at least once per month, and to stay 
safe, back up whenever needed. This is just a reminder. If you have the time today,
you can plug in your external drive, or use cloud services. You don't have to,
however it is a strong recommendation.
